# Example Project
This is boilerplate code for a Full Stack application.

## Developer Setup
1. Start the server application   
    `cd server && npm i && npm run dev`
    - Check out the [server README](./server/README.md) for more information.
    - Default Server GraphQL address: http://localhost:4000
    
2. Start the client frontend

    `cd frontend && npm i && npm start`
    - Check out the [frontend README](./frontend/README.md) for more information.
    - Default Frontend address: http://localhost:3000/



## Good Learning Ideas
1. (fullstack) Currently, the list of flowers in the UI shows a standard flower icon.  Can you persist some flower pictures into the server and show them instead of the icon when they exist? 
2. (fullstack) Currently, you can drill down from flower family to flowers. Can you also enable the server and client to drill down from flowers into families?
3. (UI) Currently, you can add a flower.  Can you also make it so we can add a family?
4. (Server) Currently, you can only add or remove flowers and families, can you add functionality to update them?
