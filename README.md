# Example Project
This is boilerplate code for a Full Stack application.

## Developer Setup
1. Start the server application   
    `cd server && npm i && npm run dev`
    - Check out the [server README](./server/README.md) for more information.
    - Default Server GraphQL address: http://localhost:4000
    
2. Start the client frontend

    `cd frontend && npm i && npm start`
    - Check out the [frontend README](./frontend/README.md) for more information.
    - Default Frontend address: http://localhost:3000/



## Good Learning Ideas
1. Currently, you can drill down from flower family to flowers. Can you also enable the server and client to drill down from flowers into families?
